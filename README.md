#Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as losing customers leads to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs. This project leverages machine learning models to predict customer churn, helping businesses implement targeted retention strategies.

Problem Statement

Many companies struggle with identifying customers who are likely to leave. By predicting churn in advance, businesses can take proactive measures such as offering promotions, improving service quality, or personalizing customer engagement. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies customers into 'churn' and 'non-churn' categories.
